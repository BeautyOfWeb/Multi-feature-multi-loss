Note: PyTorch is required to run the code

1. Run prepare_data-new.ipynb to preprocess microarray and RNAseq expression training data
2. Run prepare_snv.ipynb to preprocess snv training data
3. For subchallenge 2, run exp-train.ipynb
4. For subchallenge 3, run snv-exp-train.ipynb
5. workflow.ipynb is used to bulk submit jobs for training in local computer cluster (not necessary)
6. folder dl/ contains some useful functions used in exp-train.ipynb and snv-exp-train.ipynb
